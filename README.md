Reading math is different from reading a newspaper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be discouraged if you have to read a paragraph or a section more than once  in order to understand it. It may be helpful to have pencil, paper, and calculator at hand to sketch a diagram or make a  calculation. I find that the best way to learn math is to read and understand a section of the text before attempting the homework. In particular, you should look at the definitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the solution and try solving the problem yourself. You’ll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you do so.
