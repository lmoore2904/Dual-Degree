Learning math is different than other topics. It can take mulitple attempts to grasp a topic, but do not get discouraged! We all have our strengths and weaknesses. The best way to learn math is to read the section before attempting the exercises. While you read keep a pencil, paper, and calculator nearby to sketch a diagram or make a calculation. When you approach an exercise and feel as though you understand the section, cover-up the solution and try solving the problem. When you need help, just take a little peek.

Happy Learning!
