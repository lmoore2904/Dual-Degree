## What Is This Page?
Math. You either love it or you hate it, this website is meant for both types of people. My goal is to make math more approachable for the general audience, whether you dream of being a number-crunching engineer or would rather write your heart out as a journalist. Regardless of the final career path, we must all have a basic understanding of mathematics. There are two types of understanding I intend to address:

#### 1. Getting that A
This page is a tutorial for many different levels of math and stats. It covers the standard lessons taught in the American Education System. The idea is to make even the most complex problems be a simple as possible. The website is designed to be for those who need that extra help learning a subject or for those who are looking for a challenge.
#### 2. Answering the Dreaded Question
The most common question a teacher is asked: **_"When Will I ever Use This??"_**. Most teachers are thinking in the backs of their heads _"never"_. Instead they try and blab on like Michael Scott who is just hoping his sentence finds its way along. By the time they are done talking, you just are grateful for the silence. Now the answer will be revealed. Not just for the future engineers, but for the journalists as well.

These dual goals are the purpose of this page.

## Who Am I?

Hi, I'm Lauren. Math has been my soul and passion since middle school. I was no prodigy child, just someone who knew how to bury my head in a book and work hard. That mentality carried from middle school onto college. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with dual degrees in mathematical economics (actuarial math) and pure mathematics (proofs). In addition, I had a minor in statistics.

While in college, I balanced two jobs with the math department. My first job was working with Math Excel sections differential and integral calculus. Despite the name of the program, the sections were designed to provide any one extra help in the classroom with math. Some students had seen the subject before while others were struggling to remember prerequisite topics. My second job was working with the math department's tutoring center. This optional center was meant for students who needed extra help on homework and understanding material.

After graduation, I continued my studies and earned a M.S. in Business Analytics. Through my own struggles, I have learned how to teach. Not just others, but myself. I learned how to take clean, color-coded notes that I have saved through the years. Now I am sharing my notes with you. I may not be a certified teacher (yet), but I have a passion for teaching and sharing my love of math with others. Please enjoy!
